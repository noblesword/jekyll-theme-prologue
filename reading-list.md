Books have always been my favourite pastime. I started out with fiction, mystery and classics as a kid. I now read various genres such as biographies, self-improvement and authentic stories:

1. J K Rowling: *Harry Potter Series*
2. Enid Blyton: *(My childood companion)*
3. Robert Kiyosaki: *Rich Dad Poor Dad*
4. William Kamkwamba: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*
5. Autobiographies: *M G Gandhi, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk*
