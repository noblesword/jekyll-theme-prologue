<p>Great interpersonal skills and avid thinker. Strives to solve problems using technology and empathy. 

    It is my strong belief that understanding the needs and pain points of the user / client is much more palpable than obsessing with a solution.
    
    One of my prominent achievements include an induction to the Technology Entrepreneurship Programme from the Indian School of Business during my sophomore year. I learnt how businesses work and can apply these concepts to any company I join by being an Intrapreneur. 
    
    With these ideologies in mind I have worked across various technologies to solve user problems. I have a good quantitative ability demonstrated through my Kaggle notebooks where I have worked with datasets to perform data cleaning, descriptive and inferential statistics, data Visualization and in some cases fitted some Machine Learning models. This has also led to publishing three research papers in renowned journals such as Springer and IEEE.
    
    Having interned at companies and contributed to the open-source, I have a decent understanding of the Software Engineering life cycle and practices such as Code Documentation, Reusability, Testing. 
    
    Currently I work as a Salesforce developer and implement user stories as per client needs and integrate other managed packages such as CPQ, Apttus/ Conga CPQ, Tableau CRM.</p>
